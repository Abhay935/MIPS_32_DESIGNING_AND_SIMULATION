# MIPS_32_DESIGNING_AND_SIMULATION
This project presents the design & simulation of a high-performance five-stage pipelined 32-bit Microprocessor  Interlocked Pipeline Stages MIPS, which is a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture-based processor. 
The purpose of the RISC microprocessor is to execute a diminutive batch of instructions, with the aim of procreation the celerity of the processor. 
This processor was designed with 5 phases of pipeline in particular Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode& Register Fetch (ID), Execution & Address Calculation (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB) modules.
The designing process was done using a  module  mips32 along with different register variables like PC, NPC, and many more, register bank, memory bank, etc. 
The Proposed design is developed by Verilog HDL using XILINX software 2017.4(VIVADO) and also simulated on VIVADO using different test benches.
The main objective of this project is to create the design of a RISC(REDUCED INSTRUCTION SET COMPUTER) CPU architecture based on MIPS(Microprocessor Interlock Pipeline Stages) using Verilog HDL.
It also describes the instruction set and the architecture of the processor.
To run the different test benches and verify the output.
RISC systems use hard-wired code with a simple instruction set that needs a less costly CPU than a CISC device.
RISC processors are used in smartphones, printers, tablets, and devices that do a specific set of repeatable activities.
It also helps in exploring the depth of knowledge of microprocessor working.
